# Tech Stack: IndoChain MSME Identity Hub

Based on the business proposal document, the following is the technology stack to be used for building the IndoChain MSME Identity Hub:

## 1. Core Foundational Technologies
The IndoChain MSME Identity Hub platform will be built on three foundational technologies:

* **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):**
    * Implementation of **Hyperledger Aries** protocols[cite: 16].
    * Use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) compliant with W3C standards[cite: 17].
* **Verifiable Credentials:**
    * Tamper-evident credentials using public-key cryptography[cite: 17].
    * Selective disclosure capability for data minimization[cite: 17].
    * Credential schema registry for standardization[cite: 17].
* **Permissioned Blockchain:**
    * **BSN (Blockchain-based Service Network):** For cross-border compatibility and reduced infrastructure expenses[cite: 15, 18].
    * **FISCO BCOS:** For performance and compliance with Chinese regulations[cite: 17].
    * **Hyperledger Fabric:** For enterprise-grade security[cite: 17].

## 2. Application and Integration Components
* **Mobile Application (MSME Digital Wallet):**
    * Platform: Android and iOS (assumed based on accessibility needs).
    * Features: Intuitive interface, credential storage, QR code generation[cite: 14].
* **Verification Portal (Web-based):**
    * Frontend Technology: (To be determined, common: React, Vue, or Angular).
    * Backend Technology: (To be determined, common: Node.js, Python/Django, Java/Spring).
* **APIs for Integration:**
    * RESTful APIs for integration with banking, e-commerce, and supply chain platforms[cite: 14].
    * SDK for third-party developers[cite: 25].
* **Smart Contracts:**
    * Smart contract templates for common MSME transactions (e.g., loan automation)[cite: 15].
    * Language: As per the chosen blockchain platform (e.g., Solidity for EVM-compatible blockchains, Go or Java for Hyperledger Fabric).

## 3. Additional Infrastructure
* **Cloud Hosting:** For hosting applications, databases, and backend services (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
* **DevOps:** Tools for CI/CD, monitoring, and logging.
* **Security Systems:**
    * Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy protection[cite: 15].
    * Regular security audits[cite: 32, 46].
* **Database:** (To be determined, depending on specific architecture; could be NoSQL for profile and credential data, or relational for specific transactional data).
* **Supporting Services:**
    * Notification Services (Email, SMS, Push Notification).
    * Analytics System and Dashboard[cite: 12].

## 4. Cross-Border and Compliance Considerations
* **BSN (Blockchain-based Service Network):** Ensures cross-border compatibility and compliance with data sovereignty requirements and local regulations (especially China)[cite: 15, 24].
* **Multi-Language Support:** Support for Bahasa Indonesia, Mandarin, and English in user interfaces and documentation[cite: 14].
