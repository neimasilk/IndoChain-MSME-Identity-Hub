### Blockchain Layer

*   **Blockchain Frameworks:**
    *   **Hyperledger Fabric:** Chosen for the initial MVP, focusing on the Indonesian market, to be deployed on BSN. Selected for its enterprise-grade security, permissioned nature, and maturity. This aligns with the need for a robust and trusted platform for identity management.
    *   **FISCO BCOS:** To be considered for future expansion, particularly for the Chinese market, due to its performance and alignment with Chinese regulatory requirements. The architecture will be designed to allow for future integration or parallel deployment on BSN.
    *   ~~(Original) Hyperledger Fabric OR FISCO BCOS (To be determined for initial MVP, BSN allows for both) - for enterprise-grade security and cross-border capabilities (Fabric for general, FISCO BCOS for China focus).~~
*   **BSN (Blockchain-based Service Network):** Chosen as the primary deployment infrastructure for its cost-effectiveness, support for multiple blockchain frameworks (including Hyperledger Fabric and FISCO BCOS), and its potential to facilitate cross-border interoperability in later project phases.
