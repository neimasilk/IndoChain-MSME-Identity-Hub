# Project Charter: IndoChain MSME Identity Hub

## 1. Project Title
IndoChain MSME Identity Hub

## 2. Project Start Date
(To be determined)

## 3. Project Manager
(To be determined)

## 4. Project Objectives
*   To develop a decentralized identity hub for MSMEs in Indonesia, potentially expanding to other ASEAN countries and China.
*   To provide MSMEs with secure, verifiable, and portable digital identities.
*   To simplify access to financial services, supply chains, and marketplaces for MSMEs.
*   To enhance trust and transparency in MSME interactions.

## 5. Scope
*   Development of a platform for creating and managing MSME DIDs.
*   Issuance and verification of relevant Verifiable Credentials (e.g., business registration, certifications).
*   Integration with BSN for blockchain infrastructure.
*   Development of APIs for third-party integration.
*   Initial MVP focusing on core identity functionalities for the Indonesian market.

## 6. Key Stakeholders
*   MSMEs
*   Financial Institutions
*   Government Agencies
*   Supply Chain Partners
*   Project Development Team

## 7. High-Level Requirements
*   Decentralized Identity (DID) management based on W3C standards.
*   Verifiable Credentials (VC) issuance and verification.
*   Secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure.
*   User-friendly interfaces for MSMEs.
*   APIs for service provider integration.

## 8. Key Technology Decisions for MVP
As part of the initial planning and to ensure a focused approach for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), the following core technology stack decisions have been made, aligning with **"Step 1.1: Finalize Basic Technical Architecture & Sub-Technology Selection"** of the implementation plan:

*   **MVP Blockchain Framework:** **Hyperledger Fabric**
*   **MVP Deployment Infrastructure:** **Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN)**
*   **MVP Initial Market Focus:** **Indonesia**

This decision aims for rapid prototyping, local market validation, and leveraging robust infrastructure like BSN. The architecture will be designed with flexibility for future expansions, such as incorporating FISCO BCOS for other markets and scaling capabilities.

## 9. Project Budget (High-Level)
(To be determined)

## 10. Project Timeline (High-Level Phases)
*   Phase 1: MVP Development and Indonesia Pilot (details in `implementation-plan.md`)
*   Phase 2: Expansion and Further Integrations
*   Phase 3: Cross-border Functionality

## 11. Assumptions
*   Availability of BSN infrastructure and relevant services.
*   Cooperation from key stakeholders for pilot programs.
*   Regulatory landscape supports DIDs and VCs.

## 12. Constraints
*   Limited initial funding.
*   Evolving regulatory environment for blockchain and digital identity.
*   Technical complexities of cross-border interoperability in later phases.

## 13. Success Criteria
*   Successful MVP launch in Indonesia.
*   Positive feedback from initial MSME users.
*   Demonstrated security and reliability of the platform.
*   Interest from financial institutions or other service providers for integration.
