# Architecture Document: IndoChain MSME Identity Hub

## Introduction
This document will contain notes and diagrams of the IndoChain MSME Identity Hub software architecture as it evolves. It will cover key design decisions, component structures, data flows, and inter-service interactions.

## Initial Conceptual Architecture (Based on Proposal)

### High-Level Data Flow Diagram (MSMEs, Financial Institutions, E-commerce Platforms, etc.)
* (Diagrams will be added here later, showing how MSMEs interact with the digital wallet, how credentials are issued and verified by various parties such as Financial Institutions, E-commerce Platforms, Government Entities, and Enterprise Supply Chains [cite: 12, 14])
