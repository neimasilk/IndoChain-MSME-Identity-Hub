*   **Activities:**
    *   Review and confirm core architectural components based on `architecture-document.md` and `tech-stack.md`.
    *   **Decision:** Solidify the choice of **Hyperledger Fabric on BSN for the initial MVP focused on Indonesia.**
    *   Define specific versions of chosen technologies (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric version, specific Node.js version for backend, React version for frontend).
    *   Detail the interaction points between the frontend, backend, and the blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric on BSN).
    *   Define the initial data schema for MSME digital identity (leveraging W3C DID standards) and the first verifiable credential (e.g., "Business Registration Certificate").
    *   Outline the network configuration on BSN for Hyperledger Fabric (e.g., number of peers, ordering service setup).
    *   Update `architecture-document.md` with all finalized decisions and detailed diagrams.
