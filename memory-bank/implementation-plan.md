# Initial Implementation Plan (MVP): IndoChain MSME Identity Hub

This plan focuses on building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the IndoChain MSME Identity Hub, covering core functionalities that enable basic identity verification and initial use cases. This plan refers to Phase 1 (Foundation) and parts of Phase 2 (Pilot Implementation) from the proposal[cite: 29].

## MVP Goals:
* Enable MSMEs to create and manage their basic digital identity.
* Enable the issuance of one type of standard verifiable credential (e.g., business registration).
* Enable third parties (e.g., initial partner banks) to verify these credentials.
* Test core functionality on the BSN blockchain infrastructure.

## MVP Implementation Steps:

### Part 1: Technical Foundation & Initial Setup (Refers to Months 1-3 of Proposal [cite: 29])

1.  **Step 1.1: Finalize Basic Technical Architecture & Sub-Technology Selection**
    * **Description:** Detail the core technical architecture, including specific choices within the tech stack (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or FISCO BCOS framework on BSN). Define initial data schemas for MSME identity and the first credential.
    * **Validation:** Architecture document approved by the technical team.
2.  **Step 1.2: Setup Development Environment & Version Control**
    * **Description:** Prepare Git repositories, local and shared development environments (staging), and basic CI/CD tools.
    * **Validation:** Developers can commit, and basic builds are successful.
3.  **Step 1.3: Setup Basic Blockchain Infrastructure on BSN**
    * **Description:** Register and configure nodes on BSN. Deploy basic smart contracts for DID (Decentralized Identifier) management.
    * **Validation:** Able to create a basic DID on BSN through a test interface.

### Part 2: Core MVP Component Development (Refers to Months 3-6 of Proposal [cite: 29, 30])

4.  **Step 2.1: Develop Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Module - Basics**
    * **Description:** Implement basic Hyperledger Aries functionalities for key creation and management by MSMEs. Focus on MSMEs' ability to own and control their DIDs.
    * **Validation:** An MSME (simulated) can create a key pair and an associated DID.
5.  **Step 2.2: Develop MSME Digital Wallet (MVP Wallet Application) - Basics**
    * **Description:** Develop a basic mobile application (one platform first, e.g., Android) that allows MSMEs to:
        * Register and create a digital identity (DID).
        * Store one type of verifiable credential (e.g., a "Mock Business Registration Certificate" for testing).
        * Display the credential in a basic form (perhaps a raw QR code).
    * **Validation:** Test users can install the app, create an identity, and view the stored dummy credential. Test in Month 3 for MVP wallet[cite: 30].
6.  **Step 2.3: Develop Credential Issuance System - Basics**
    * **Description:** Create a simple web interface for one authorized issuing entity (e.g., IndoChain system admin at this stage) to issue one type of verifiable credential (e.g., "Mock Business Registration Certificate") to an MSME's DID.
    * **Validation:** Admin can issue a credential to a test MSME, and the credential appears in the MSME Digital Wallet.
7.  **Step 2.4: Develop Verification Portal - Basics**
    * **Description:** Create a simple web interface allowing a third party (e.g., system admin or initial partner bank) to verify an MSME's credential by scanning a QR code from the MSME Digital Wallet or entering a Credential ID. Implement a basic consent flow from the MSME.
    * **Validation:** A third party can successfully verify a test MSME's credential with MSME consent.
8.  **Step 2.5: Core Blockchain Integration**
    * **Description:** Ensure that DID creation, credential issuance, and verification logging (hash or status) are securely recorded on the BSN blockchain.
    * **Validation:** Test transactions are successfully recorded and retrievable from BSN (as per Month 6 target [cite: 30]).

### Part 3: Initial Testing & Iteration (Refers to Months 6-7, preparing for Pilot [cite: 29])

9.  **Step 3.1: Internal End-to-End Testing**
    * **Description:** Conduct thorough testing of the MVP workflow: MSME identity creation -> credential issuance -> storage in wallet -> verification by a third party.
    * **Validation:** All major test scenarios pass without critical errors.
10. **Step 3.2: Initial Feedback Collection & UI/UX Design Iteration**
    * **Description:** Gather feedback from internal prospective users or a small group of selected MSMEs (if feasible at this stage) on the usability of the Digital Wallet and portals.
    * **Validation:** A prioritized list of UI/UX improvements is created.
11. **Step 3.3: Basic Security Audit**
    * **Description:** Conduct an internal security review or with a limited external consultant on the MVP components.
    * **Validation:** Identified critical security issues have been addressed.

### Overall MVP Validation:
* The MVP platform can be demonstrated to investors and initial partners.
* Ready for the "Pilot Implementation" phase with 100 MSMEs in each country (Indonesia and China), though the initial MVP might focus on one country for early technical simplification before scaling to cross-border[cite: 29].
* Integration with 2-3 financial institutions (as verifiers) can commence[cite: 29].
