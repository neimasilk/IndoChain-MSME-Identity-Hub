# Project: IndoChain MSME Identity Hub

Welcome to the IndoChain MSME Identity Hub project repository!

This project aims to develop a blockchain-based decentralized digital identity verification platform specifically designed for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia and China. Our vision is to empower MSMEs through secure, portable digital identities that enable financial inclusion, verify business credentials, and facilitate cross-border trade.

## Development Methodology: Vibe Coding Indonesia V1.0

This project is being developed using the "Vibe Coding Indonesia V1.0" methodology. This methodology emphasizes thorough upfront planning, clear task division between human developers and AI assistants, and continuous iteration based on well-defined *baby steps*.

Key to this methodology is the use of a **"Memory Bank"** (the `.memory-bank/` folder), which serves as a central repository for all contextual information and project planning. This ensures that both human developers and AI assistants have a shared and up-to-date understanding of the project.

## The `.memory-bank/` Folder

The `.memory-bank/` folder contains the following critical documents that guide project development:

* **`product-design-document.md`**: Describes the product vision, the problem being solved, target users, the solution, key features, and core use cases for the IndoChain MSME Identity Hub.
* **`tech-stack.md`**: Details the technology stack chosen to build the platform, including blockchain technologies, applications, integrations, and supporting infrastructure.
* **`implementation-plan.md`**: Outlines the initial implementation plan for building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), including specific steps and their validation methods.
* **`status-todolist-suggestions.md`**: A dynamic document to be filled and updated by Gemini (or the Planning AI). It includes the current project status, a future To-Do List, and a "Baby-Step To-Do List" suggestion for the next implementation step.
* **`baby-step.md`**: A document to be filled by Gemini (or the Planning AI) with detailed instructions for each small implementation step (baby step). These instructions are designed to be clear and unambiguous, ready for an AI Coding Assistant (like Jules) or a junior developer to execute.
* **`architecture-document.md`**: A document that will be updated as the project progresses. It will contain notes, diagrams, and architectural decisions regarding the software structure, components, and data flow.
* **`progress-log.md`**: Tracks completed `baby-steps` that have been implemented, tested, and committed, along with dates and a brief summary of the work.
